Current Status

Pre alpha, which means java-deobscurify can't be used to deobfuscate real world
projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Build

java-deobscurify is built using apache maven:

$ mvn clean package


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

$ java -jar target/java-deobscurify-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar [old src] [obfuscated src]

old src is the path to directory with the unobfuscate source. This should
be the java source files which you have manually deobfuscated.

obfuscate src is the path to the directory with the obfuscated source.

The output will be something like this:

oldClass.java:
  100% newClass.java
  77% otherNewClass.java

This means that oldClass from old src is 100% equal in the obfuscation
comparision to newClass from the obfuscated src. This doesen't mean that
things like class names are 100% equal. Only adjectives which won't change
during obfuscation are compared.
